W-9) 1. Create your own webpage using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap called
"index.html". It should have:
a. A title
b. Three or more types of headings
c. Some paragraphs
d. One or more ordered lists
e. One or more unordered lists
f. One or more tables
g. Some line-breaks
h. Some horizontal lines
i. Some comments
j. Various text styles: bold, italic, strike-through, underline
Make sure that the file is reasonable large: 2-3 screen worth at least.
(You can add dummy content if you wish). 2. View the above HTML file on a browser, using a URL such as: 3. http://localhost/index.html OR double click on html file. 4. Learn to look at the HTML source from the browser window. 5. Now create some internal bookmarks and links using the "name=xyz"
property and "href=#xyz".
Type the URLs for these internal bookmarks directly onto the browser. 6. Now split your webpage into multiple HTML files, or equivalently
create more HTML files. For example, you may have a separate HTML
file describing your interests or educational background.
Provide links from the main index.html to these other HTML files.
Provide also some links to external websites (e.g. google). 7. Now move all the HTML files to another directory. Your links should
still work (they should be relative links). 8. Embed one or more images in any of the HTML files. The images
should reside within a sub-directory called "images". 9. Now include some styles within HTML tag elements. For example:
table border, cell background, link colour, text colour, background
colour, list style, text font, etc. 10.
Now include some of the earlier styles in the "style" tag of the
HTML "head" section, instead of marking the styles in individual
HTML tag elements. 11.
Now have a separate css file for the above styles, so that the same
can be included in multiple HTML files. 12.
Insert some special characters such as &, <, >, etc. in your HTML
file.
